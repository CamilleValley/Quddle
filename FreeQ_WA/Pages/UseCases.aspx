    <h2>Why use Quddle</h2>
    <h3 class="spaceBAfter">Replace phyical lines</h3>

    Quddle replaces physical lines and waiting rooms with virtual, mobile lines:

    <h4>Your customers can enter the line from their home computer, cell phones, touch screen kiosks, or the Web.</h4>
    <h4>Or, your employees can add them to the line from Quddle Queue Manager.</h4>
    <h4>Your customers can roam freely while they wait.</h4>
    <h4>Quddle sends them an Email / SMS or calls shortly before their turn arrives. (this feature is coming soon)</h4>

    All you need is a Web browser. It's that simple.
    <br />
    <br />
    See examples of when to use Virtual Queues,
    <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink1" runat="server" 
        NavigateUrl="~/Pages/Examples.aspx">here</asp:HyperLink>
    .<br /><br />
    And did we already tell you that Quddle is completely free?
